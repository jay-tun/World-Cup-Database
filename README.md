This is another project made for freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certificate. This project uses Shell script and PostgreSQL where given a data sheet, the insert_data.sh works to insert data from the datasheet into the database. The script queries.sh allows you to output certain computation from the inserted data into the database and the expected output on how it should look like is given in the expected_output.txt.
